- Build consistency in daily coding.
- Prepare for technical interviews.
- Develop logical thinking ability.

   
## 🛠 Tech Stack
- Python 3.x


## 📘 Concepts Practiced (By Day)

Day 1 – User Profile Validation System
- Handles user input and validates strings.
- Uses conditional statements for checking correctness.
- Applies simple logic to verify user details.
- Displays output in a structured format.

Day 2 – Smart ID & Credential Validator
- Stores credentials using lists.
- Uses for-loops to iterate data.
- Applies rule-based validation conditions.
- Handles errors logically.

Day 3 – Student Performance Analyzer
- Stores student marks in lists.
- Processes marks using loops.
- Assigns grades with conditional logic.
- Applies bonus rules using name length and roll number.

Day 4 – Cyber Activity Risk Analyzer
- Stores activity logs in lists.
- Analyzes data using loops.
- Categorizes risks as Low, Medium, or High.
- Applies personalization using register number logic.

Day 5 – Emergency Resource Dispatch Analyzer
- Categorizes resource requests using lists.
- Processes each request with for-loops.
- Counts valid and invalid requests.
- Applies personalized filtering using PLI (L % 3).
